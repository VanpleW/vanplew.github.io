Welcome to my website! My name is Pei Wang, and I'm currently a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My research interests lie in the intersection of signal processing and machine learning, with a focus on computer vision and its application to edge devices.

During my undergraduate studies at City University of Hong Kong, I worked on optical imaging systems and photoacoustic imaging systems. I've also explored my interest in developing edge devices using various sensors, such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and I have experience with sensors powered by FPGA.

My ultimate goal is to use my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact on society. Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to reach out to me with any inquiries or potential collaborations.
